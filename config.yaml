  openstack-origin:
    default: distro
    type: string

      Repository from which to install.  May be one of the following:
      distro (default), ppa:somecustom/ppa, a deb url sources entry,

      Supported Cloud Archive sources include: cloud:precise-folsom,
      cloud:precise-folsom/updates, cloud:precise-folsom/staging,
      cloud:precise-folsom/proposed.

      Note that updating this setting to a source that is known to
      provide a later version of OpenStack will trigger a software
      upgrade.

      Note that when openstack-origin-git is specified, openstack
      specific packages will be installed from source rather than
      from the openstack-origin repository.

    type: string
    description: |
      Specifies a YAML-formatted dictionary listing the git
      repositories and branches from which to install OpenStack and
      its dependencies.

      Note that the installed config files will be determined based on
      the OpenStack release of the openstack-origin option.
